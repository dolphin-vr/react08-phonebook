###  Phone Book

Simple Phone Book application that can store phone contacts in LocalStorage and search in contacts list by filter.

This project is a refactoring version of [react04-phonebook](https://github.com/dolphin-vr/react04-phonebook) to using Vanilla Redux for state management.
Also Redux Persist uses to work with LocalStorage.
